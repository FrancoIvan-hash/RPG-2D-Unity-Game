# RPG-2D-Unity-Game
A basic 2D RPG game made using Unity following the book "Developing 2D Games with Unity - Independent Game Programming with C#" by Jared Halpern.
By following the already mentioned book, I am self-teaching Unity to develop games, as well as how to program games (and possibly other programs) using C#.
